```

state1 ->  {
                leftOperand : valid,
                operator : null,
                rightOperand : null
            } 
       
            
state2 ->  {
                leftOperand : valid,
                operator : valid,
                rightOperand : null
            } 


state3 ->  {
                leftOperand : valid,
                operator : valid,
                rightOperand : valid
            }
